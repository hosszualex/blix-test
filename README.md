# Android Task - Chat App By Alex Hosszu

Due to the 3 hour time constraint, I was not able to provide full solution as per the task becuase i chose to focus on a cleaner implementation in regards to the code.

What is implemented:
- Friends list
- Ability to add a new friend
- Everything is saved locally using Room
- Able to send message
- Automatic response for the following sentences: "Hi! How are you?", "Did you manage to sell your car?"
